# Now, let's get to the science.

---

## Fact: Forecasting is Important
- We take weather forecasts for granted
- Consider the state of affairs *before* we had weather forecast access 24/7 on our phones
- Example: Galveston Hurricane of 1900
  - **Deadliest natural disaster in US History**
  - 6,000 - 12,000 fatalities
  - Forecast that day: "Rain Saturday, with high northerly winds; Sunday rain, followed by clearing."

---

## Galveston Hurricane Aftermath

---

## Forecasting basics
The modern challenge: **so much data**. How do we make sense of it all?

<img src="forecast-diagram.jpg" width=45%%>

---

## Learning Objectives

**By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:**
- Access and interpret some of the most common observational data in meteorology
- Understand how weather models use this data to generate a forecast simulation
- Have the tools to create your own weather forecast

---

# Part 1: Observations

---

## Radar

- Radar stands for **Ra**dio **D**etection **A**nd **R**anging
- Useful for finding **precipitation**
- Real-time data with **high spatial and temporal resolution**

![bg left:55%](willy-p-figs/ida-radar-loop.gif)

---

## Radar Basics

1. Radar sends out a pulse of energy
2. Energy bounces off objects in atmosphere and returns to radar
3. Radar detects the **strength** and **timing** of return

---

  <img src="doppler_ani.gif" style="width:90%;"/>
  <p style="font-size: 14px;">Source: NOAA</p>
</div>

Keep in mind: the radar is rotating at different angles to sample the whole sky!

---

## Key Radar Quantities
- Three important quantities from radar:
    - **Reflectivity**: How much energy is bouncing back to the radar
    - **Time delay**: How long it takes for the energy to bounce back
        - **Shorter time delay = closer to the radar**
    - **Elevation angle**: The angle at which the radar is pointing
        - **‚¨áÔ∏è elevation angle = closer to the ground**

### More Radar Features:
- dual polarization to detect precipitation type ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òî
- doppler velocity for radar-relative motion üå™Ô∏è

## Satellite Data

---

## Satellite basics
- Take measurements of the atmosphere from space
- Weather satellites normally observe the **brightness of Earth's atmosphere** in specific wavelength bands
  - They **do not** directly measure temperature or water vapor‚Äîjust radiation
- Often our *only* source of data in remote parts of the world

## Question: How far away are geostationary satellites from Earth?
- A) 200 miles
- B) 2,000 miles
- C) 20,000 miles
- D) 200,000 miles

---

## Types of satellite imagery
- **Visible Imagery**: shows reflected sunlight (**day only**)
  - Great for clouds and surface features
- **Infrared (IR) Imagery**: shows cloud-top temperatures
    - Can see cloud tops and motion **day or night**
- **Water Vapor Imagery**: measures wavelengths absorbed by water vapor **day or night**
    - Great for finding cyclones, dry slots, atmospheric rivers, etc.

## Visible imagery
**Light colors**: thick clouds, snow

 **Dark colors**: clear skies

---

<!-- ![bg right:50%](ir-satellite.gif) -->

## Infrared imagery
- Different colors = different temperatures
- Colder temps = higher clouds = red/white
- Warmer temps = lower clouds = blue/green

## Water vapor imagery
- Different colors = different moisture levels
- White, blue, and green = moist air
- Yellow, orange, and red = dry air

## Upper air observations

---

## Upper air observations basics
- Measurements taken directly from the atmosphere
- Essential for understanding vertical structure of atmosphere and predicting weather
- Collected via:
    - Weather balloons (radiosondes)
    - Aircraft

---

## Weather balloons and radiosondes
- Weather balloons carry radiosondes into the atmosphere
- Radiosondes measure:
    - Temperature
    - Humidity
    - Pressure
    - Wind speed and direction
- Data is sent back to the ground via radio

---

## Reading upper air observations
- Show vertical profiles of temperature, moisture, and wind
  - **Temperature**: red line
  - **Dew point**: green line
  - **Wind speed**: barbs
  - **Wind direction**: direction **from which** wind blows
- Temperature and dew point are close = clouds (usually)!
- Temperature increases with height = inversion

# Part 2: Forecast Models

---

## What are weather forecast models?
- Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models simulate the atmosphere with math \& physics
- **Input**: All the data we've discussed so far, past model runs (sometimes)
- **Output**: Predicted atmospheric conditions (temperature, precipitation) at future times

---

## How do NWP models work?
1. **Data collection**: Gather data from satellites, weather stations, balloons, etc.
2. **Data assimilation**: Combine observations with model data to create a starting point for the model
3. **Model integration**: Solve equations of motion, thermodynamics, moisture, etc. *forward in time*
4. **Post-processing**: Transform model output into usable information

---

<img src="willy-p-figs/climate-model-diagram.png" width=60%>

---

## Global models
 - Cover the entire globe, run every 6-12 hours
 - Produce forecasts out to 16 days
 - Examples: GFS (Global Forecast System), ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts)

---

## Regional Models
- Cover smaller areas, run more frequently, higher resolution
- Produce forecasts out to 3-5 days
- Examples: NAM (North American Mesoscale), HRRR (High-Resolution Rapid Refresh), WoFS (Warn-on-Forecast System)

---

</div>

---

## Why aren't forecasts from models perfect?
- **Observations are not perfect**
    - Missing data, errors, spotty coverage...
- **Physical equations are not perfect**
    - Simplifications, approximations, parameterizations...
- Computational limits and rounding errors affect precision
  - Butterfly effect

---

## Example: Convective parameterization
- A typical thunderstorm ‚û°Ô∏è ~15 miles diameter
- GFS (American) model ‚û°Ô∏è ~ 18 mile grid spacing
  **Problem: Model too coarse to *explicitly resolve* individual thunderstorms**

---

**Parameterization**: represent small-scale processes with simplified equations and estimates

<img src="willy-p-figs/arakawa-scheme.jpg" width=60%>

---

#### Example of Forecast Spread: Spaghetti Plot

![bg right:60%](willy-p-figs/cyclone-track.png)

---

## Using model output
- U.S. weather models available for free (may not last long in current administration üòÖ)
- Advanced tools sometimes behind paywall
  - Create soundings, take cross-sections, apply fancy algorithms
- **Do not put all your eggs in one forecast model basket!**

---

- [Tropical Tidbits](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/) (easy interface, lots of models)
- [Pivotal Weather](https://www.pivotalweather.com/) (beautiful visualizations, some paid features)
- [College of DuPage](https://weather.cod.edu/forecast/)
- [NOAA NSSL Warn-on-Forecast System](cbwofs.nssl.noaa.gov/forecast) (high-resolution, only run some days)
- Lots of apps!

---

# Part III: Putting it all together

---

### Building a forecast

- **Start globally to forecast locally**
- **Global-scale** phenomena
  - Ex: Satellite data ‚û°Ô∏è global flow, upper air observations ‚û°Ô∏è jet stream
- **Synoptic-scale**
  - Fronts, high/low pressures, radar data ‚û°Ô∏è precip
- **Mesoscale/Local Scale**
  - Surface observations, convective quantities

---

## Snellman Funnel

<img src="willy-p-figs/snellman-funnel.jpg" width=70%>

---

### My approach for NJ forecasting
1. Look at global/CONUS satellite imagery.
2. Check out jet stream with upper air maps.
3. Start looking at synoptic features with radar, surface analyses, and surface observations.
4. (Optional) Look at "special" (severe, winter) weather fields.
5. Observe local conditions in NJ.
6. Consult appropriate forecast models.
7. Make forecast narrative for time period of interest.
8. **Verify your forecast!**

---

- [NOAA Weather Prediction Center](https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/)
- [NWS Forecast Points](https://www.weather.gov/forecastpoints)
- [Ventusky](https://www.ventusky.com/)

---

### Conclusions
- Forecasting requires data, models, and experience.
  - Don't fall for data overload. Stick with the basics.
- Satellite, radar, upper air, and surface observations are all useful tools that give us different information.
- Forecast models are our most powerful tools but need to be used judiciously.
- Practice as much as you can, but keep it fun üòÑ.
