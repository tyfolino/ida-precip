# Meeting notes
## Oct 22nd, 2024
To-do:
- ~~Keep messing around with ML~~
- ~~Fix hodographs so that they have a smaller extent~~
- Make a plot, maybe 3 or 2x3 showing the ensemble mean updraft helicity at 23, 0, and 1 UTC to compare to our geopotential height plots
- Look at variables at initialization times

Questions for Tom:
- What variables are the most useful to look at at initialization time, even back to 17Z? PW, but what about other fields?
- We haven't look at shear, is it worth looking at?
- Upper air is too coarse to provide meaningful results.

**Wet & Dry Ensemble Members**

Numbers use 1 indexing not 0

Dry: 1, 6, 13, 17

Wet: 5, 7, 8, 11

## October 29th, 2024
To-do:
- ~~Plot UH paintball plots~~
- ~~Look at spatial differences in Bunkers storm motion vector~~
- ~~Plot trajectory plots for 23, 0, and 1Z~~
- ~~Pick four gridboxes and plot wet & dry ensemble members hodographs, 1Z only, with our new vectors~~
- Plot the theta-e field for say the wettest and driest member
- Jennifer Catto, Sebastian Schwann ETH european front
- Go back through the mesoscale textbook to see at what role fronts play in convection.
- Thought from Tom: Warm front and mesoscale features and bringing favorable conditions, plus vertical shear to produce supercells.
- Signif testing on vector differences
- Make UH track plot from 23-02Z
- Find theta-e fronts in wet vs dry ensembles
- First part of paper will be overview, showing fields that we later look at in our ESA, hodographs etc.
- Data will include radar, height maps, surface analyses, cyclone phase space, track map
- Make hodographs just NW and SW
- Pick one wet day and dry day and compare theta-e

- Add SLP to one plot.
